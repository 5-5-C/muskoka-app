        I will write some great placeholder text – and nobody writes better placeholder text than me, believe me – and I’ll write it very inexpensively. I will write some great, great text on your website’s Southern border, and I will make Google pay for that text. Mark my words. I write the best placeholder text, and I'm the biggest developer on the web by far... While that's mock-ups and this is politics, are they really so different? This placeholder text is gonna be HUGE.

The concept of Lorem Ipsum was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. design jobs non-competitive. The best taco bowls are made in Trump Tower Grill. I love Hispanics!

If Trump Ipsum weren’t my own words, perhaps I’d be dating it. Lorem Ipsum is the single greatest threat. We are not - we are not keeping up with other websites.

We have so many things that we have to do better... and certainly ipsum is one of them. I’m the best thing that ever happened to placeholder text. My placeholder text, I think, is going to end up being very good with women. I think my strongest asset maybe by far is my temperament. I have a placeholding temperament. This placeholder text is gonna be HUGE.

All of the words in Lorem Ipsum have flirted with me - consciously or unconsciously. That's to be expected.

Lorem Ipsum's father was with Lee Harvey Oswald prior to Oswald's being, you know, shot.

That other text? Sadly, it’s no longer a 10. This placeholder text is gonna be HUGE. An 'extremely credible source' has called my office and told me that Lorem Ipsum's birth certificate is a fraud. You have so many different things placeholder text has to be able to do, and I don't believe Lorem Ipsum has the stamina.
